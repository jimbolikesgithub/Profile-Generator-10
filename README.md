# Profile-Generator-10

--- This challenge was all about creating a profile generator, which, when ran, gives
the user a prompt, which, when filled out and finished, will generate an index.html file
containing one or multiple cards for a team (manager, engineer, intern). Then, before one 
could be finished, they must TEST the code in test files stashed in the test folder. Truly, 
this task was most difficult, but enjoyable nontheless. ---

----------
* Ran 'npm init -y', 'npm install inquirer', 'npm install jest', and 'npm i' for safe measures
